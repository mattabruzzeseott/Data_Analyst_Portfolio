# Spotify Exploratory Data Analysis

__Code:__
`spotify_data_analysis.ipynb`

__Description:__
Spotify is a proprietary Swedish audio streaming and media services provider founded on April 23, 2006 by Daniel Ek and Martin Lorentzon. It is one of the largest music streaming service providers, with over 456 million monthly active users, including 195 million paying subscribers, as of September 2022. In this project we will be exploring and quantifying data about music from Spotify, and drawing valuable insights. This includes performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and creating data visualizations using data scraped from Spotify.

__Skills:__
data cleaning, data analysis, data visualization, descriptive statistics, python coding

__Technology:__
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib

## Datasets

Both datasets used for this EDA were imported from Kaggle.

The datasets for this project are quite large, so I have added the links to them below rather than uploading their .csv files. The same dataset links are also available in the introduction of the `spotify_data_analysis.ipynb` project.
