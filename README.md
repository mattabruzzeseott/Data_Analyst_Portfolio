# Matthew Abruzzese Ott - Data Analysis Portfolio

This repository contains a portfolio of data science and data analysis projects that I completed for academic and self-learning purposes. It serves as a showcase of my skills, a platform to share my projects, and a way to track my progress in data science and data analysis-related topics.

## About Me

Hey, I'm Matt! I am a recent Applied Mathematics graduate with a passion for data analysis and solving complex problems. I have a technical background and hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree from Stony Brook University, with a major in Applied Mathematics and Statistics, and a concentration in Data Analysis. I have a strong understanding of statistical analysis and programming languages such as Python, R, and SQL. With my proficiency in data cleaning, wrangling, exploration, and visualization, my goal is to turn raw data into actionable insights that drive business decisions. I am currently seeking an entry-level data analyst position to apply my skills and further develop my career in the field.
