__Description:__
The COVID-19 pandemic has caused significant disruptions to global health, economies, and societies. One of the most effective strategies for controlling the spread of the virus is through vaccination. With many countries and organizations working towards vaccinating their populations, tracking the progress of global vaccination efforts has become increasingly important. This Tableau dashboard aims to provide an interactive and visually engaging way to track the global progress of COVID-19 vaccinations. It will also help to identify areas that may require additional attention to improve vaccination rates and ensure that everyone has access to lifesaving vaccines. This project uses COVID-19 vaccination data from Sept. 4, 2020 - Oct. 25, 2021.
